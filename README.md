**Sorting**

The provided code is a Python script that implements three sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is applied to arrays of different sizes (20, 100, 1000, and 4000 elements) that contain random integers ranging from 1 to 6000. The code measures the execution time of each sorting algorithm for the given arrays and displays the sorted arrays along with the corresponding execution times.

The Insertion Sort algorithm iterates through the array, gradually sorting the elements by inserting each element in its correct position among the already sorted elements.

The Merge Sort algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to split the array into smaller segments, sort them, and then merge the sorted segments to produce the final sorted array.

The Quick Sort algorithm uses a pivot element to partition the array into two sections: elements smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot. It then recursively sorts these two sections.

The script generates random arrays and applies the sorting algorithms to each of them, recording the time taken for each sorting operation. The sorted arrays and their respective execution times are printed as output.

**LCS**
The provided code consists of three sections, each implementing a different approach to finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two given strings.

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
This section computes the LCS of two strings using a recursive brute force method. It defines a function `lcs_bf` that calculates the LCS of two strings by comparing their characters. The function recursively explores all possible character matches and returns the length of the LCS. It also reads input from a text file ('LCS1.txt'), which contains pairs of strings, and allows the user to select an index from the provided options. The chosen strings are then processed to find their LCS using the brute force method. The execution time of this approach is measured using the `timeit` library.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
In this section, the code implements the LCS problem using dynamic programming. The function `lcs_dp` is defined to calculate the LCS of two strings using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. The algorithm constructs a matrix to store intermediate results and uses it to efficiently compute the LCS length. Similar to the brute force approach, the code reads input from a file ('LCS1.txt'), lets the user select an index, and computes the LCS of the chosen strings. The execution time is measured using `timeit`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach with Backtracking:**
This part of the code combines dynamic programming with backtracking to not only find the LCS length but also retrieve the actual LCS string itself. The function `LCS_DP_CB` implements the dynamic programming algorithm, maintaining a matrix for counting and another matrix for arrow marks indicating the optimal path. The code then uses backtracking to retrieve the LCS from the arrow marks. Similarly, the program reads input from a file ('LCS2.txt'), lets the user choose an index, and calculates the LCS of the selected strings, including the LCS string itself. Execution time is measured using `timeit`.

The code provides user-friendly interfaces for selecting input strings and displays the calculated LCS length and string, along with the time taken for computation. Each section demonstrates a different method for solving the LCS problem, showcasing both brute force and optimized dynamic programming techniques.
